                                vehicle is an estimate, only, and many factors
                                that cannot be assessed without a physical
                                inspection of the vehicle may affect actual
                                value. For purposes of this website, we use the
                                services of a third-party vendor to provide
                                Trade-In Value calculations. While we believe
                                this information is reliable, we are not
                                responsible for and do not guarantee the
                                accuracy or reliability of the information.
                                Please see your local Ford dealer for
                                information regarding actual trade-in
                                availability and value. 27. Don’t drive while
                                distracted or while using handheld devices. Use
                                voice-operated systems when possible. Some
                                features may be locked out while the vehicle is
                                in gear. Not all features are compatible with
                                all phones. 28. The vehicle's electrical system
                                (including the battery), the wireless service
                                provider's signal and a connected mobile phone
                                must all be available and operating for 911
                                Assist to function properly. These systems may
                                become damaged in a crash. The paired mobile
                                phone must be connected to SYNC, and the 911
                                Assist feature enabled, in order for 911 to be
                                dialed. When the feature is ON, 911 Assist uses
                                your paired and connected mobile phone to assist
                                occupants to contact emergency services by
                                dialing 911 if your airbag deploys or, on
                                certain vehicles, if the emergency fuel pump
                                shut-off is activated. Aftermarket on-board
                                diagnostic devices may interfere with various
                                vehicle systems including Vehicle Health Report
                                and 911 Assist. To avoid interference, remove
                                the device or contact the device maker for more
                                information on compatibility. 29. Alexa Built-in
